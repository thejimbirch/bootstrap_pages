The Bootstrap Pages module provides a suite of Content Types, Taxonomies, and
Views to work with the Bootstrap Paragraphs module.

**Content Types**

  * Article

The content types are fully configured to have proper Meta tags and Schema.org
markup; optimized, responsive images, preconfigured freindly URLs; and an
organized administration.  Once installed, you hve control over changing what is
 in configuration, and overriding templates and styles in your theme.

**Taxonomies**

  * Topic
  * Type

Taxonomies can be used in conjunction with articles to create different views. A
 view block that takes a term is included.

***Examples:***
Type: Blog, News, Press Release

Two views are included that can be added to pages or articles using the View
Paragraph bundle.  Pass an argument to filter!
